15-Minute Voice Recording Script for Tortoise TTS Training 
========================================================= 
[Warm-Up — 1 minute] 
Hello, my name is Can. I am recording this audio to train a high‑quality 
text‑to‑speech model of my voice. I will read calmly and clearly. I will 
vary my pace, my tone, and my sentence length. First, I will warm up with 
simple phrases. Today is a good day. I feel focused and relaxed. My voice 
is steady, and my breathing is easy. I will speak at a natural speed. I 
will articulate consonants and vowels carefully. I will keep my mouth 
close to the microphone, but not too close. This is only a warm‑up, so I 
will keep it short and gentle. I am ready to begin. 
[Casual Conversation — 4 minutes] 
Let me talk the way I normally talk to a friend. Hi there. How are you 
doing today? I hope you are doing well. This morning I woke up a little 
earlier than usual. I drank a glass of water, stretched my back, and 
opened the window for some fresh air. The street was quiet. I heard a 
bird somewhere beyond the trees. I like mornings when everything feels 
unhurried. I made a small breakfast. Sometimes I have eggs and bread. 
Sometimes I have oatmeal with milk and a sliced banana. Today I made 
coffee and ate a slice of toast with a bit of butter. I checked my 
messages, but I tried not to get pulled into the screen. I prefer to 
begin the day with a clear mind and a simple plan. 
In the afternoon I usually work on a few focused tasks. I like to set a 
timer, so I stay on track. When I get distracted, I gently return to the 
task in front of me. I remind myself that steady progress is better than 
a burst of energy followed by a slump. If I feel stuck, I change the 
environment, take a sip of water, or quickly review the goal. Small 
adjustments make a big difference. Later in the day I prepare a simple 
lunch. It might be pasta, rice, salad, or a sandwich. I try to include 
vegetables and some fruit. I also like to take a short walk if the 
weather is nice. 
In the evening I slow down. I enjoy reading a few pages of a book, 
watching a short video, or listening to calm music. I put my phone away 
one hour before sleep. I dim the lights and take a few deep breaths. Good 
sleep makes the next day easier. These are ordinary habits, but they add 
up. When I think about habits, I like to start small. If a habit is too 
heavy, I avoid it. If it is light and easy, I repeat it. Over time, easy 
repetitions become strong routines. I also keep notes about what works 
for me and what does not. I am not trying to be perfect. I am simply 
trying to be consistent and calm. These small choices shape my day. They 
also shape my voice right now, as I speak in an even and natural tone. 
[Storytelling — 4 minutes] 
Now I will tell a short, simple story with a clear beginning, a middle, 
and an end. One evening, after a long day, I decided to take a quiet 
walk. The sun was low, and the light turned the buildings soft and gold. 
I followed a familiar street toward a small park with a narrow path. As I 
walked, I noticed details that I often miss. A bicycle chained to a 
railing. A cat in a window, blinking as if the air itself was a surprise. 
A shopkeeper sweeping the front step with steady strokes. The rhythm of 
the broom felt like a small metronome for the block. 
At the corner I met an older man I had seen before. He was wearing a 
simple coat and a cap. He nodded hello and asked how my day was going. I 
said it had been busy but good. He said, “Busy is fine if you remember to 
breathe.” We talked for a minute about small things: the weather, the 
quiet street, and the smell of bread from the bakery at the end of the 
block. Then I kept walking. I passed a bench where two friends were 
talking in low voices. Their conversation sounded calm. They were not in 
a hurry to finish their thoughts. 
I reached the park just as the streetlights turned on. The path curved 
between a row of trees. The first stars appeared. A cool breeze moved the 
leaves, and the branches made a low whisper. I took a deep breath. The 
day felt complete in that small moment. I had not done anything dramatic 
or new, yet I felt restored. On the way back I stopped by the bakery. I 
bought a small loaf of bread, warm in the paper bag. The baker smiled and 
said, “Good evening.” I replied, “Good evening,” and walked home. The 
city had a quiet heartbeat. I could hear it in the distance, steady and 
kind. 
[Informative / Explanatory — 3 minutes] 
Now I will switch to an informative tone. I will speak clearly and at a 
moderate pace. A text‑to‑speech system converts written text into spoken 
audio. To build a voice that sounds like a real person, the system needs 
clean recordings with a range of tones, speeds, and sentence types. 
Background noise can confuse the model, so recording in a quiet room 
matters. A consistent distance from the microphone keeps the volume 
steady. It also helps the model learn the natural resonance of the voice. 
When you record, aim for a variety of content. Casual speech captures 
rhythm and natural phrasing. Storytelling captures emotion and longer 
sentences. Explanations capture clarity and structure. Short lists, 
dates, numbers, and names teach the model how to pronounce common 
patterns. For example: January, February, March; Monday, Tuesday, 
Wednesday; one, two, three; ten, twenty, thirty; nineteen ninety‑nine; 
two thousand twenty‑five. You can also include times like seven thirty, 
nine oh five, noon, and midnight. You may read addresses and short 
commands, but keep them simple and clean. 
A good dataset does not need dramatic acting. The goal is steady, human 
speech with enough variety to cover everyday sounds. Smiles can be heard 
in the voice, even if the listener cannot see you. Good posture opens the 
breath. If your mouth gets dry, take a small sip of water and continue. 
If you make a mistake, pause, repeat the sentence, and move on. Clean, 
simple recording wins every time. 
[Dialogue & Q&A — 2 minutes] 
Now I will practice a short dialogue by playing both parts. Question: 
“Excuse me, could you help me find the library?” Answer: “Sure, walk 
straight for two blocks and turn left at the corner.” Question: “Is it 
open today?” Answer: “Yes, it is open until six in the evening.” 
Question: “Do I need a card to enter?” Answer: “You can enter without a 
card, but you need one to borrow books.” Question: “Thanks for the 
information.” Answer: “You are welcome. Have a nice day.” 
Another mini dialogue. Question: “What time does the train leave?” 
Answer: “The next train leaves at nine fifteen.” Question: “Which 
platform is it?” Answer: “Platform three.” Question: “How long is the 
trip?” Answer: “About forty minutes.” Question: “Great, I will get a 
ticket now.” Answer: “The ticket machine is to your right.” 
Short Q&A in a calm tone. What is your name? My name is Can. Where are 
you from? I am from a city with long streets and bright lights. What do 
you do? I like to learn, build, and share. What are you recording? I am 
recording a clear and steady dataset for a text‑to‑speech model. How long 
will you record? I will record for about fifteen minutes. What do you 
want the model to learn? I want it to learn my natural rhythm, my vowels, 
my consonants, and my range of tones.

okay, sure, of course.

[Closing Reflection — 1 minute] 
I am close to the end of this recording. I have read in several styles: 
casual speech, storytelling, informative explanation, dialogue, numbers, 
and short lists. I have included variations in pace, tone, and emphasis. 
I have tried to keep the sound clean and the pronunciation clear. If I 
made a mistake, I allowed a short pause and then repeated the line. This 
is a practical way to build a dataset for a text‑to‑speech model. 
Thank you for listening to this entire session. Recording for fifteen 
minutes is not difficult when the content is simple and steady. Variety 
matters, but calm delivery matters more. As I finish, I take one breath 
in and one breath out. My voice returns to silence. This concludes the 
recording for the training model. End of script.
